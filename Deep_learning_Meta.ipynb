    "Figure 2. (A) Average AUC on 10 hold out test sets of the DL framework against six machine learning algorithms for prediction of ER status from metabolomics data: recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART) (0.83), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (0.74), support vector machine (SVM) (0.89), deep learning (DL) (0.93), random forest (RF) (0.89), generalized boosted models (GBM) (0.89), and prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) (0.88). The above algorithms were run 10 times on different train/test splits. We used pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test to estimate the statistical significance of the difference in performance between DL and other methods (∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗ p < 0.1). (B) Bipartite graph of the top 20 important metabolites extracted from DL model and other machine learning algorithms. Large nodes represent the models and small nodes are metabolites. A connection between metabolite and the model means this metabolite is one of the top 20 high importance metabolites extracted by this model."
